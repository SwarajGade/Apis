Normalization:
->Normalization is the process of organizing the structure of a relational database to minimize redundancy(multiple copies of the same information are stored in more than one place at a time) and dependency.
->the goal of normalization is to design a database sche,a that reduces data dupicacy and aims to ensure data integrity by organizing data into logical definite structures.
->this process helps to eliminate or reduce anomalies such as insertion, update, and deletion anomalies, which can occur when data is duplicated or dependencies are not properly managed.


Forms of Normalization
1. First Normal Form(1NF)   --There should be no repetition of columns
2. Second Normal Form(2NF)   --1NF+Every non-key attribute is fully dependent on the entire primary key
3. Third Normal Form(3NF)  --2NF+Every non-transitively dependent on primary key
4.Boyce-Codd NormalForm(BCNF)  -- 3NF+Every determinant is a candidate key
5. Fourth Normal Form(4NF) --Decomposition beyond 3NF to eliminate multi-valued dependencies.
